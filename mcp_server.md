# MCP Server User Guide

CAPEsolo ships an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server so an assistant or script can drive
analysis programmatically: submit samples, poll jobs, read results, and step a halted
sample under the interactive debugger.

Install project dependencies (including `mcp`) in your environment first.

---

## 1. Running the Server

| Transport | Command | Use when |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `stdio` (default) | `CAPEsolo-mcp` | The MCP client runs in the same VM and launches the server itself. |
| `streamable-http` | `CAPEsolo-mcp --transport streamable-http --host 192.168.56.10` | CAPEsolo runs in a guest VM and the client is on the host. |

`python -m CAPEsolo.mcp_server` is equivalent to `CAPEsolo-mcp`.

---

## 2. Configuration

Settings resolve in this order, first match wins:

1. **Command line flag** - `--transport`, `--host`, `--port`, `--path`
2. **`cfg.ini`** - the optional `[mcp_server]` section
3. **Built-in default**

`cfg.ini` lives at `python-path\site-packages\CAPEsolo\cfg.ini`. The whole
`[mcp_server]` section is optional; if it is absent every value falls back to its default
and the server behaves exactly as it always has.

### 2.1. `[mcp_server]` keys

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `transport` | `stdio` | `stdio` or `streamable-http`. |
| `host` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. For host access, use the guest's host-only adapter IP. |
| `port` | `8000` | Bind port. Ignored for `stdio`. |
| `path` | `/mcp` | HTTP path the endpoint is served on. Ignored for `stdio`. |
| `allowed_hosts` | derived from `host:port` | Comma-separated `Host` headers to accept. A `host:*` entry matches any port. |
| `allowed_origins` | empty | Comma-separated `Origin` headers to accept. Requests without an `Origin` are allowed. |

### 2.2. Token (environment only)

Set `CAPESOLO_MCP_TOKEN` in the guest before starting the server to require
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every HTTP request. Leave it unset to run without auth.

**Do not put the token in `cfg.ini` - that file is tracked in git.**

```
set CAPESOLO_MCP_TOKEN=some-long-random-value
CAPEsolo-mcp --transport streamable-http --host 192.168.56.10
```

---

## 3. Remote Access (guest VM to host)

Point the host client at `http://<guest-ip>:<port>/mcp` using its remote/URL server form
rather than `command`/`args`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "capesolo": {
      "url": "http://192.168.56.10:8000/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer some-long-random-value" }
    }
  }
}
```

Drop the `headers` block if you are not using a token.

### 3.1. Security

* Use a **host-only or internal** VM network. Never bridge the guest to a real LAN or
  forward this port to the internet: these tools detonate samples, and the debugger tools
  can read and patch process memory.
* Bind the guest's host-only adapter address rather than `0.0.0.0`. Host header validation
  (DNS-rebinding protection) is always enabled and is derived from the bind address, so a
  `0.0.0.0` bind requires setting `allowed_hosts` explicitly or every request is rejected.
* Anything listening inside the guest is also reachable by the malware running there. The
  token and Host validation are hardening; VM isolation remains the real boundary.
* The host client parses data produced inside an infected guest (file names, strings,
  disassembly). That is inherent to remote analysis, but treat that output as untrusted.

---

## 4. Analysis Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `capesolo_analyze_sample` | Submit a sample. Key args: `sample_path`, `package` (`Auto-detect` by default), `options`, `timeout`, `enforce_timeout`, `interactive_debug`. |
| `capesolo_analyze_password_zip` | Submit a password-protected ZIP. Key args: `zip_path`, `zip_password` (defaults to `infected`), `archive_member_path` (required when the ZIP holds multiple files), plus the args above. Extraction is handled by `SFlock2`. |
| `capesolo_get_job_status` | Job state: `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`. |
| `capesolo_cancel_job` | Request termination of a running job (the same signal as the GUI Kill button). |
| `capesolo_get_results` | CAPEsolo JSON results using existing keys (`target`, `behavior`, `signatures`, `payloads`, `configs`, `detections`). |
| `capesolo_get_job_log_tail` | Last N lines of `analysis.log`. |
| `capesolo_render_html_report` | Generate an HTML report from a completed analysis. |
| `capesolo_list_payloads` | Payload artifacts from analysis output. |
| `capesolo_list_dropped_files` | Dropped files under the analysis `files` output. |
| `capesolo_list_debug_logs` | Debugger and analysis log artifacts. |
| `capesolo_update_yara` | Update CAPE/community YARA rules. |

---

## 5. Interactive Debugger Tools

Available only while a job submitted with `interactive_debug=True` is halted at a
breakpoint. That flag adds `idbg=1` to the options and forces a 4 hour timeout, the same
as the GUI **Interactive Debugger** checkbox. Pair it with breakpoint options such as
`bp0=ep`. See [interactive_debugger.md](interactive_debugger.md) for the GUI equivalent.

Addresses are hex; the `0x` prefix is optional.

### 5.1. Execution control

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `capesolo_dbg_wait_break` | Block until the target halts. Call once after submitting to catch the first break. |
| `capesolo_dbg_step` | Single-step. `mode` is `into`, `over` or `out`. |
| `capesolo_dbg_continue` | Resume until the next breakpoint or the timeout. |
| `capesolo_dbg_run_until` | Resume until a given address. |

These three return the new instruction pointer, the registers, and a short disassembly
window in one response.

### 5.2. Inspection

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `capesolo_dbg_status` | Whether a session is active and where it is halted. |
| `capesolo_dbg_get_registers` | Register set, parsed and raw. |
| `capesolo_dbg_get_stack` | Stack window around the stack pointer. |
| `capesolo_dbg_read_memory` | Up to 16384 bytes, returned as hex. |
| `capesolo_dbg_disassemble` | Defaults to the current instruction pointer. |
| `capesolo_dbg_list_modules` | Loaded modules with base addresses, sizes and paths. |
| `capesolo_dbg_list_threads` | Threads with start addresses; the current thread is flagged. |
| `capesolo_dbg_list_breakpoints` | Hardware breakpoints with their debug register slots. |

### 5.3. Modification

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `capesolo_dbg_set_breakpoint` | `slot` is `next` or a debug register `0`-`3`. |
| `capesolo_dbg_delete_breakpoint` | Delete by debug register number. |
| `capesolo_dbg_set_register` | Decimal or `0x`-prefixed hex value. |
| `capesolo_dbg_set_cip` | Move the instruction pointer; picks EIP or RIP by bitness. |
| `capesolo_dbg_modify_flag` | Set, clear or flip the Zero, Sign or Carry flag. |
| `capesolo_dbg_patch_bytes` | Overwrite memory with a hex byte string. |
| `capesolo_dbg_nop_instruction` | Replace an instruction with NOPs. |

## 6. Quick Connection Test

1. Start your MCP-enabled client with the config above.
2. Call `capesolo_get_job_status` with a fake id:
   * `{"job_id":"test"}`
3. Expected response:
   * `{"found": false, "error": "Job not found: test"}`

---

## 7. Examples

### 7.1. Local stdio, no configuration

Nothing in `cfg.ini`. The client launches the server itself:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "capesolo": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "CAPEsolo.mcp_server"],
      "cwd": "C:\\path\\to\\CAPEsolo"
    }
  }
}
```

Equivalent for a client that resolves entry points: `"command": "CAPEsolo-mcp"`.

### 7.2. Host-only network, no token

Guest adapter is `192.168.56.10`. In the guest:

```ini
[mcp_server]
transport = streamable-http
host = 192.168.56.10
port = 8000
```

Start with `CAPEsolo-mcp`. On the host:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "capesolo": { "url": "http://192.168.56.10:8000/mcp" }
  }
}
```

`allowed_hosts` is omitted, so it is derived as `192.168.56.10:8000` automatically.

### 7.3. Host-only network with a token, config-free

Leave `cfg.ini` alone and pass everything on the command line. In the guest:

```
set CAPESOLO_MCP_TOKEN=8f3c1d9b0a7e4f26
CAPEsolo-mcp --transport streamable-http --host 192.168.56.10 --port 9000 --path /capesolo
```

On the host:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "capesolo": {
      "url": "http://192.168.56.10:9000/capesolo",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer 8f3c1d9b0a7e4f26" }
    }
  }
}
```

### 7.4. Binding all interfaces

`0.0.0.0` cannot derive a `Host` header, so `allowed_hosts` must be explicit or every
request is rejected:

```ini
[mcp_server]
transport = streamable-http
host = 0.0.0.0
port = 8000
allowed_hosts = 192.168.56.10:8000, capesolo-vm:*
```

### 7.5. Typical analysis run

1. `capesolo_analyze_sample` with `{"sample_path": "C:\\samples\\evil.exe"}`
2. Poll `capesolo_get_job_status` until the state is `completed`
3. `capesolo_get_results` (optionally `capesolo_render_html_report`)

### 7.6. Typical interactive debugger run

1. `capesolo_analyze_sample` with
   `{"sample_path": "C:\\samples\\packed.exe", "options": "bp0=ep", "interactive_debug": true}`
2. `capesolo_dbg_wait_break` to catch the entry-point break
3. `capesolo_dbg_disassemble` and `capesolo_dbg_get_registers` to look around
4. `capesolo_dbg_step` with `{"mode": "over"}`, or `capesolo_dbg_set_breakpoint` then
   `capesolo_dbg_continue`
5. `capesolo_dbg_continue` to run to completion, then `capesolo_get_results`

## 8. Talking to the Assistant

Once the server is connected you drive everything in plain language - the assistant picks
the tools. You never type tool names or JSON. These are phrasings that work well.

### 8.1. Running an analysis

| Say this | What it runs |
|----------|--------------|
| "Detonate `C:\samples\evil.exe` and tell me what it does." | submit, poll, read results |
| "Analyze this sample as a DLL instead of an exe." | `package="dll"` |
| "Run it for 5 minutes and force the full timeout." | `timeout=300`, `enforce_timeout=True` |
| "The zip is password protected, the password is `infected`." | the password-ZIP tool |
| "That zip has three files, use `payload.exe`." | `archive_member_path="payload.exe"` |
| "Is it done yet?" | job status |
| "Skip the strings, they're too long." | results with `include_strings=False` |
| "Kill the run, it's hung." | cancel job |
| "Give me the last 50 lines of the log." | log tail |
| "Build me an HTML report." | render HTML report |
| "What did it drop, and what payloads came out?" | dropped files + payloads |
| "Update the YARA rules first." | update YARA |

### 8.2. Starting a debugger session

| Say this | What it runs |
|----------|--------------|
| "Run `packed.exe` under the debugger and stop at the entry point." | submit with `interactive_debug=True`, `options="bp0=ep"`, then wait for the break |
| "Break when it allocates memory." | submit with the matching `bp0=`/`base-on-api` option |
| "Has it hit the breakpoint yet?" | debugger status, or wait for break |
| "Wait up to 10 minutes for the next break." | wait with `timeout_seconds=600` |

Breakpoint placement comes from analyzer **options** at submit time (`bp0=ep`,
`base-on-api=...`); the `capesolo_dbg_*` tools take over once the target is halted.

### 8.3. Driving a halted target

| Say this | What it runs |
|----------|--------------|
| "Where are we?" | status / registers / disassembly |
| "Step into that call." / "Step over it." / "Finish this function." | step `into` / `over` / `out` |
| "Step 10 instructions and describe what changed." | ten steps, diffing registers |
| "Run to `0x401A20`." | run until |
| "Set a breakpoint at `0x401000` and continue." | set breakpoint, continue |
| "Drop the breakpoint in DR1." | delete breakpoint |
| "Keep going." | continue |
| "What breakpoints are set?" | list breakpoints |

### 8.4. Inspecting state

| Say this | What it runs |
|----------|--------------|
| "Show me the registers." | get registers |
| "Disassemble the next 40 instructions." | disassemble with `count=40` |
| "What's the code at `0x401000`?" | disassemble at that address |
| "Dump 256 bytes at RAX." | read memory at the current RAX |
| "Is the string at RDX readable? Decode it." | read memory, decode the hex |
| "What's on the stack right now?" | get stack |
| "Which DLLs are loaded?" | list modules |
| "How many threads, and where did they start?" | list threads |

### 8.5. Changing execution

| Say this | What it runs |
|----------|--------------|
| "NOP out the instruction at `0x401234`." | NOP instruction |
| "Patch those two bytes to `90 90`." | patch bytes |
| "Set RAX to 1 so the check passes." | set register |
| "Flip the zero flag so it takes the other branch." | modify flag |
| "Skip that call, move RIP past it." | set CIP |
| "Force the anti-debug check to fail." | typically flag or register change, then continue |

### 8.6. Longer requests that chain tools

These read like one instruction but drive many calls. They work well because each
execution tool returns the new instruction pointer, registers, and nearby disassembly in a
single response.

* "Run `packed.exe` under the debugger, stop at the entry point, then single-step until
  you reach a call into `VirtualAlloc` and show me the arguments."
* "Step over calls until RIP leaves the packer stub and lands in a different module, then
  tell me which one."
* "Break at the entry point, dump 512 bytes there, and tell me if it looks packed."
* "Set a breakpoint at `0x401000`, continue, and when it hits show me the stack and
  registers."
* "Continue to the next break. If it does not break within two minutes, say so instead of
  waiting."
* "Analyze `evil.exe`, and when it finishes summarize the signatures and configs, but skip
  the strings."

### 8.7. Phrasing that helps

* **Name the address or register** - "dump 64 bytes at RSP" beats "dump the stack area".
* **Give a stopping condition** - "step until the call returns" or "step at most 20 times";
  open-ended stepping burns round trips.
* **Say how long to wait** - "wait up to 5 minutes" maps to `timeout_seconds`. The default
  is 120, and a `continue` that does not break returns `state: running` rather than hanging.
* **Ask for the reasoning** - "step through this and explain what the decryption loop is
  doing" gets you an interpretation, not just a register dump.
* **Hex is assumed** - "401000" and "0x401000" both work.
