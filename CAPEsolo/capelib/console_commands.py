"""Parsing and validation for the interactive debugger's command box.

Turns what the analyst types into the two-letter command and pipe-delimited payload capemon
expects, or into an error naming what was wrong. Pure functions, free of wx imports (see
tests/test_console_commands.py).

Two things shape this. The box used to split its input into command and arguments and then
send only the command - `md 0x401000` dumped at CIP rather than at the address, and
`ru 0x401000` reached the monitor with no address at all - so the payload has to be built
here and tested. And anything typed was uppercased and sent, so a typo came back as
"Unknown command" from the target rather than being caught before it left: validating locally
is what lets a wrong argument count be reported against a usage string instead.
